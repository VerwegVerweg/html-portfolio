<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>I just love the action in the movie.<br/>
The sound Track everything, and no I'm not a fan off Tom Cruise(sorry Tom no heart feallings)</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>Moana, the title character, breaks away from the traditional princess mold.<br/>
    She’s a smart, fiery young woman who chooses to be a forward-thinking 
leader rather than a damsel in distress..<br/>
It’s a must-see for both girls and boys, offering inspiration and entertainment</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>What can I say, I do have kids and whatch movies with the kids.<br/>
It's a great movie. Amazing lessons and relatable to parents with kids and Teenagers.</p>
